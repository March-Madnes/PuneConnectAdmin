<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Abstract


- This project aims to develop an iOT and Mobile integrated NFC bus pass system for Indian Metropolitan Cities like Pune, which will address the current limitations of the paper-based bus pass system. The proposed solution will provide users with a more convenient and environmentally friendly way of using the bus transit system.

- The administrative side of the project, which gives the checkers the tools to confirm the legitimacy of the user, is the focus of the present repository. It has the ability to read user data using both a qr code system and a NFC mechanism.

- The software also grants the administrator access to user information using only the user's Aadhar number, which is useful for confirming the legitimacy and ownership of passes that have been given.
